My Excel inventory system was designed for Air Filters used at a number of big commercial buildings downtown. I was able to create a system where each filter was assigned a code reference which would assist in tracking filters of that size and subsequently order from suppliers. Also, with this system, each property could be charged back with the number of filters used at site.
